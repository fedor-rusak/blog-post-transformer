I need a simple way to style my blog post entries in html pages I like. My personal thing.

## Before using

Remember to download actual site [sources](https://github.com/fedor-rusak/fedor-rusak.ru) before running any scripts. Don't worry it is ignore by *.gitignore*.

## Idea

Use nodeJS to make transformation of text files into final blog post html pages.

## History

### 1.0.2
 - script now makes simple template-based rendering of page from contentIndex file

### 1.0.1

 - initial package stuff
